## ‚ùî: What is REST-API Automation Testing
REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style commonly used in web services development. In REST API automation testing, various tools and frameworks are used to simulate client requests and verify the responses received from the API. This involves sending different HTTP methods (such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) with specific parameters and payloads to interact with the API endpoints.

## üëú This repo should be contains
  * This repo contain example code of REST-API test using Python [Requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
  * `assertion` are ready used for assertion
  * `unittest` is used to small scope test
  * Example REST-API on [Reqres.in](https://reqres.in/)

## üî• Getting Started
Let's begin our attempt at REST API automation testing with Selenium Python. Please ensure that the following requirements are ready prepared.
  1. Python v3.11 ready installed on your computer
  2. [Requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) Library
  3. Unittest (optional)
  4. Pytest-html Library for run the test and report output test suites

## „ÄΩÔ∏è Cloning & Importing the Project
  * Clone the project `git clone https://github.com/okinrtestcase/REST-API-Automation.git`
  * Wait until all project has cloned & Open in your text editor
 
## ‚ôÇÔ∏è Running the tests
